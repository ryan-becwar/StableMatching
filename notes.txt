TODO:

Generate plot of data factoring in drafting distribution, global greedy, regret, pagerank and optimal scores

Have 3 plots: one of noise -  global(product), noise - global(min), noise - location

Also, implement regret based on linear regression, as this has the property of updating the regression in constant time
