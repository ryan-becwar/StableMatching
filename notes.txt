TODO:

Generate plot of data factoring in drafting distribution, global greedy, regret, pagerank and optimal scores

Have 3 plots: one of noise -  global(product), noise - global(min), noise - location

Also, implement regret based on linear regression, as this has the property of updating the regression in constant time


Normalized on mean greedy order value, plotted on x axis by stdevs from this

for noise 0.0 - 1.0
  for 100 instances:
    for 100 orderings: find mean, stdev
    run pagerank, normalize on found stdev

OUT:
|  data for noise   |
n=50 noise=0.1 instance: 7 mean: stdev: pagerank z score: regret z score:


Paper Preparation:
Literature review:
  consult john dabney's disertation references.
  -potential criticisms:
    running on random data, which may have particular behavioral characteristics.
    DIMACS - research center - publishes inputs to problems such as TSP
